## About
This requires MacOS 14+ (Sonoma), which introduced [Interactive Widgets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/adding-interactivity-to-widgets-and-live-activities).

### Note
This is quick experiment in Swift, I'm an Android dev by trade. The codebase could and should be improved.
